Recommender System for UCI Restaurant Data based on Siraj RS Tutorial

UCI restaurant data http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Entree+Chicago+Recommendation+Data

For the UCI data, we will use all the past restaurant searches as what that user liked. Anything more complex would be harder to interpret for the span of this project.

1) Learning Summary
# Admin: Learn git README formatting
# ML: Recommender model and background mathematics
# Python:
# Software principles: Structure of program, functions and separation/containerisation 

2) Write-Up Summary:
2.1) Current algorithm
- Parses UCI data and methodology (with data assumptions)
- Lightfm model with WARP loss
- Functioning but performance not quantified
2.2) Required Improvements
- Good articles if search for recommender system accuracy and WARP loss
- Accurancy: metrics for accuracy and beyond accuracy of a recommender system
- Pipeline: needs split between model training and use (so we don't need to continuously train model)
- Visualisation: how else can we visualise data?
